## Original Question
New York City's hottest new startup Bookface is recruiting new software developers to handle their unprecedented growth! You are attempting to impress Zack Muckerberg with your software development prowess, and it is your job to catalog the applicants. Having received a multitude of applications from newly graduated students and experienced developers alike, it is now your job to implement a system to organize them so that you only select the best possible applicants to help the company grow. Being that you are the hiring manager for one of the world's biggest up-and-coming tech companies, it is important that your system is able to filter out the applicants that are not up to par. Applicants can list up to 3 skills and 3 companies that they have previously worked for, and you are responsible for the implementation of a refined search system that returns specific applicants depending on both the aforementioned criteria and the applicant's GPA.
