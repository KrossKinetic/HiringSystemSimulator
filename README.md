# HiringSystemSimulator

HiringSystemSimulator is a simple program written in Java for simulating a complete hiring system manager for job applicants. It demonstrates my skills in writing Object Oriented Programs using Java.

This program was made as part of my CSE214 Course at Stony Brook University.
